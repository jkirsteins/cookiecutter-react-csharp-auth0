# react-csharp-auth0

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for
bootstrapping an application with:

- React SPA frontend; and
- C# backend; and
- Auth0 user management.

## Auth0

The Auth0 JWT is used only to bootstrap a cookie-authenticated session.

**This solves**: Safari does not log out upon page refresh, and you gain the
ability to invalidate sessions.
